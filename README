For use with firefox >>>
To install,
1. Got to about:addons in the address bar.
2. Click on the gear icon in the top-right corner and select "Install Add-on From File..."
3. Select the zipped extension file

However take note that firefox needs any extension to be signed by them before use even extension from local files.
If the extension is not signed, firefox will popup error thinking that the extension is corrupted.

If you don't want to go through the signing process hasle. Use Firefox Developer Edition or Nightly Build.
And toggle the xpinstall.signatures.required options on about:config to False.

Alternatively, if you are a developer and wants to just load this as temporary extension.
You can go to about:debugging > "This firefox" > "Load Temporary Add-on"
